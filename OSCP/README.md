PWK VM MSF Error  
If you are seeing an error message like below with the “bignum too big to convert” there is a simple fix. I had this happen a lot when trying to launch msfconsole and it was super annoying. It actually got so bad that I couldn’t run any post modules without the same error message.

root@kali:~# msfconsole
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/lib/msf/core/payload/android.rb:92:in `not_after=': bignum too big to convert into `long' (RangeError)
...
...
    from /usr/bin/msfconsole:48:in `<main>
The Fix:
gedit /usr/share/metasploit-framework/lib/msf/core/payload/android.rb
On line 92 comment out the entire line to look like this:
#cert.not_after = cert.not_before + 3600*24*365*20 # 20 years
Save
